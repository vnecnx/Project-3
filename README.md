IMPORTANT: Document all design decisions and their reasoning here.

---03/18---
- Came up with alarm-clock & lamp idea
- made divs to shape lamp and clock

---03/19---
- Added wine bottle

---03/20---
- Began working on GSAP js script
    - Error shows up, saying 'ReferenceError: gsap is not defined at main.js:24:16'
    - This seems to be making my animation not work at all
    - Edit: issue fixed, i needed to add the GSAP js script tag in my html

---03/21---
- Switched around colors
- Button now changes text when clicked
- Lamp light addition (incomplete)
    - Issues with making it into a trapezoid
    - Will eventually make this light toggleable via the .lamp-chain


---TODO---
___ Figure out a way for animations to be toggleable/reversed when buttons are clicked
        - If there is no answer to this, that's fine, just keep it as is
